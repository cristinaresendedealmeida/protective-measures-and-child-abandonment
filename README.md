**Data Analysis: A Correlation between Violence Against Women and Child Vulnerability**

**Data Analysis Project for a Remote Internship Position, UNICEF UK**

**1. Context and Motivation**

The protection of children and adolescents is a core mission of UNICEF. Globally, child well-being is closely linked to the safety and stability of the family environment. In Brazil, domestic violence represents one of the biggest risks to child safety.

This data analysis project explores a crucial hypothesis: that there is a correlation between the rates of violence against women and the number of children who need to be placed in institutional care.

**2. Methodology of Analysis**

To conduct this analysis, I used public data compiled from two main sources:

* **Violence Indicator:** The number of protective measures granted to women. This metric serves as a proxy for the occurrence and registration of domestic violence cases.
* **Child Vulnerability Indicator:** The number of children in institutional care. This data reflects the number of children who have been separated from their families due to situations of risk and vulnerability.

The data was processed and visualized using Python, with the pandas library for data manipulation and matplotlib / seaborn for graphical visualization.

**3. Key Findings and Visualization**

The visualization below demonstrates the correlation found between the two metrics in different Brazilian states.

In this graph, we can observe a clear and concerning trend. The states with the highest number of protective measures granted are, for the most part, the same states that have the highest number of children in institutional care.

The visualization shows a positive correlation between the two variables, suggesting that where domestic violence is more prevalent, the need for institutional care for children is also higher.

**4. Implications and Key Conclusions**

* **Correlation, Not Causation:** It is essential to emphasize that this analysis demonstrates a correlation, not a direct cause-and-effect relationship. However, the strength of this correlation gives us an indication of the deep shared vulnerability between mothers and children in violent environments.
* **The Impact on Children:** Domestic violence does not only affect the adult victim; it places children at direct risk, requiring interventions like institutional care.
* **Implications for Combating Violence:** The data suggests that improving safety for women and implementing more actions to reduce domestic violence can be effective solutions to reduce the number of children in institutional care. By protecting mothers, we indirectly protect children.
* **Value for UNICEF:** The ability to identify and visualize these correlations allows development agencies to prioritize resources and actions in regions that present the highest combined risks.

**5. Next Steps and Future Vision**

This project is only the starting point. As next steps, it would be valuable to:

* Integrate socioeconomic data (poverty index, access to healthcare) to deepen the analysis and identify other risk factors.
* Expand the historical series to analyze the evolution of this correlation over time.
* Utilize Machine Learning models to predict the need for institutional care in different regions.

**Conclusion:** Data analysis is a powerful tool in the fight against violence and in the protection of children. This project demonstrates how data, when well-utilized, can direct strategic actions and positively impact the lives of thousands of families.
